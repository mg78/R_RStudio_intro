In this session we will look at why you would want to use R and RStudio and how to get started. Ideally, you’d complete a few things before the practical session: Watch the introductory video, get R and RStudio installed on your machine and get a brief overview of RStudio. If you don’t have time to do this, don’t worry, the practical session will be useful anyway. In the practical session we will focus on reading in some data, doing a bit of data manipulation, visualising data, complete some simple stats and write up the results. 2.0.1 Watch the introductory video (~20 minutes) In this video I talk you through what we will be doing in the practical session and why. I also introduce various resources to get you started. You can download the slides of the presentation (with clickable urls) below.
